Tech Stack Details:
React: I chose React as  frontend library. 
TypeScript: TypeScript was used to write your code. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, which helps catch type-related errors during development and enhances code maintainability.
Vite: Vite is a fast build tool for frontend development. Its designed to be quick and efficient, making it a suitable choice for modern web development workflows. Vite provides features like hot module replacement (HMR) for faster development.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build efficient and responsive user interfaces. It provides pre-designed utility classes that make styling components faster and more consistent.
Project Setup: I likely started by setting up my project using Vite and configured it for TypeScript and React. This included installing necessary dependencies and creating a project structure.
Component Design:  I designed my website with a component-based architecture. Each part of my e-commerce site, such as product listings, cart, and checkout, was built as individual React components.  
Styling with Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS simplifies styling by allowing me to apply utility classes directly. I customized Tailwind's configuration to match my website's design requirements.
Routing: To navigate between different sections of my website (e.g., product listing, cart, checkout), I likely used React Router or a similar routing library to handle client-side routing.
User Interaction: I implemented features such as adding products to the cart, updating quantities, and calculating the total cost. This involved handling user input and maintaining a responsive user interface.
Testing and Optimization: Throughout development, I tested my website on different devices and browsers to ensure it's responsive and functions correctly. I optimized performance by lazy loading images and using code-splitting techniques.
Deployment: Finally, I deployed my e-commerce website to  Netlify. Deployment typically involved building my project for production, configuring domain settings, and ensuring everything works in a live environment.

I hope this provides a clearer perspective on how I approached building the "Baby-cart" e-commerce website.
